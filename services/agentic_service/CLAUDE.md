# Auto-Forge MAS — UI/UX + Coder Agent Build — Working Notes

This file is durable cross-milestone memory for the build described in
`instructions .md`. Read it before continuing this build in a new session —
it records real decisions, deviations from the spec, and gotchas discovered
during implementation that the original spec doesn't (and can't) know about.

The per-milestone implementation plan lives at
`C:\Users\ASUS\.claude\plans\soft-petting-star.md` and gets overwritten each
milestone — that file is scratch, **this file is the durable one**.

## Environment facts (verified, not assumed — re-check if anything seems off)

- **MongoDB is a real Atlas cluster**, not localhost — `.env`'s `MONGODB_URI` overrides the
  `localhost` default in `config.py`. The real project **"E-commerce Platform"**
  (`proj_a2e3d529`) / feature **"Login"** (`feature_a44033b8`) already has: approved SRS v3,
  approved Architecture Plan v5 (saved under the **legacy `sds` artifact type**, not the newer
  `architecture_plan` type — both are handled via fallback lookup), approved UI/UX v1
  (`ui_metadata` + the `LoginForm.jsx` component, both approved).
- **Default LLM model is `qwen3-coder:latest` via Ollama**, not `gemma4` — changed (both live
  Mongo `llm_settings` and `.env` `DEFAULT_LLM_MODEL`) in M1 because `gemma4` could not reliably
  follow the structured JSON schemas the UI/UX and Coder planning prompts require.
- **Agentic (tool-calling) model** is also `qwen3-coder:latest` via
  `app/providers/agentic_model_factory.py` (`AGENTIC_MODEL_OVERRIDE` in `.env`/`config.py`).
- Docker Desktop is installed and used by `sandbox_service` for `run_shell`.
- Playwright + Chromium are installed. UI/UX preview rendering uses **vendored UMD bundles**
  (React/ReactDOM/Babel-standalone/Tailwind CDN script) at `app/agents/uiux_agent/vendor/` and a
  static HTML shell — **not** a Vite dev server. Gotcha: the babel `<script type="text/babel">`
  tag must **not** have a `data-presets="react"` attribute — adding it breaks rendering under
  `file://` navigation (Chromium treats Babel's transform output as an ES module, which is
  blocked by CORS under `file://`). Default (no `data-presets`) works fine and still handles JSX.
- System `rg` (ripgrep) is **not installed** and not installable without admin in this
  environment — `search_code` (Coder Agent tool) uses a pure-Python regex line-walker instead,
  capped at 200 results.
- `requirements.txt` periodically reverts to UTF-16 encoding on disk for unclear reasons (not
  something my edits cause directly). If `Edit` fails with "string not found" on this file,
  re-`Read` it fresh, decode if needed, and `Write` the whole file back as UTF-8.

## Key deviations from `instructions .md` (and why)

1. Graph orchestrator (M0) stage nodes are plain pass-through functions, not calls into real
   agents — intentional, matches the roadmap's own intent that M6 is when real agents get wired
   into the graph.
2. Security/QA graph stages are already auto-approved pass-through nodes with no human
   `interrupt()` (anticipating M7) — no `security_agent`/`qa_agent` stub *modules* exist yet,
   only the graph nodes; M7 adds the actual stub classes.
3. Added `ArtifactType.UI_INTEGRATION_MANIFEST` (not in the doc's original enum list). Reusing
   `UI_METADATA` for both the metadata JSON and the integration manifest created a real
   ambiguity for any future lookup (`apply_design_system_patch`, future Coder Agent context
   loading) — caught during M2 testing, fixed properly rather than patched around.
4. UI/UX component generation uses a **delimited text format**
   (`---MOCK_PROPS_JSON---` / `---JSX_CODE---`), not JSON with an embedded multi-line code
   string — avoids JSON-escaping failures for real JSX source text.
5. `design_system.json` persistence (UI/UX step 7) is triggered from
   `approval_service.submit_approval` directly (checks `agent_name=uiux_agent` +
   `artifact_type=UI_METADATA` + approved), **not** from the graph node — the real `uiux_node`
   doesn't exist until M6, so this hook had to live somewhere that already fires today.
6. Coder Agent tools (M3) are built by a per-run factory `build_coder_tools(project_id,
   feature_id)`, not bare module-level `@tool` functions — required because every tool's
   LLM-facing signature (per the doc itself) takes no `project_id` argument, so each tool must
   already be bound to one workspace (and one feature's approved UI components) at construction
   time.
7. **`langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent` is deprecated** in the installed version (moved to
   `langchain.agents.create_agent`) — M4 uses `create_agent` instead, per the doc's own explicit
   instruction to use whichever API is current. Signature/behavior is equivalent for this
   build's purposes (`model`, `tools`, `system_prompt=`, state keyed on `"messages"`).
8. **Added `workspace_service.commit_changes(project_id, feature_id, message)`** (not in the
   original doc's `workspace_service` method list). The coding loop's tools only ever touch the
   working tree, never git — `diff_against_main()`/`merge_feature_branch()` both operate on
   *committed* history, so without an explicit commit step between "the agentic loop finished"
   and "there is a diff to review," `diff_against_main()` silently returns an empty diff even
   though real files were written (confirmed directly: `git status`/`find` showed all 6 real
   files on disk while `diff_against_main()` reported `added: []`). M5's `diff_node` should call
   `commit_changes(...)` right after the coding loop (or after `verify_node` passes) and before
   computing the diff.
9. **M5's `verify_node` skips (doesn't fail) a build/lint/test script that isn't defined in
   `package.json`** — user decision, since the real project has zero build tooling scaffolded
   yet (see below). Only a script that exists and returns nonzero, or `npm install` itself
   failing, is a hard failure.
10. **`CoderAgentInput`/`CoderAgentOutput` (`coder_agent/schemas.py`) were rewritten** from the
    original artifact-ID-based sketch to the already-loaded-context shape, matching
    `ArchitectureAgentInput`/`UIUXAgentInput`'s established convention (same change UI/UX went
    through between its stub and M1). `CoderAgentOutput` kept its original 5 fields and gained
    `code_plan_json`, `verification_passed`, `artifact_ids`.
11. **`ArtifactType.CODE_DIFF` is the merge-gating artifact type** for the Coder Agent (shared
    across both `file_tree_json` (JSON format) and `merge_report_markdown` (MARKDOWN format), same
    pattern as `UI_METADATA`). `approval_service.py`'s Coder Agent hook triggers
    `merge_approved_feature`/`discard_rejected_feature` on this type regardless of format.
12. **M6: `domain` moved from `GATED_STAGES` to `AUTO_APPROVED_STAGES`** in
    `graph_orchestrator_service.py`, joining `security`/`qa`. This was a real, pre-existing gap,
    not a new decision invented for M6: with `domain` gated, the graph would pause at
    `approve_domain` forever with no Domain Agent artifact a human could ever approve through the
    normal `POST /artifacts/{id}/approval` flow (there is no way to advance except calling
    `resume()` directly, bypassing the approval system entirely). `STAGE_SEQUENCE` (the true
    pipeline order, used for edge-wiring) is now separate from `GATED_STAGES` (which stages get a
    real `approve_*` node) -- previously these were conflated via `GATED_STAGES + AUTO_APPROVED_STAGES`
    concatenation, which only worked because auto-approved stages happened to all be at the end.
13. **M6: `uiux_node`/`coder_node` are real calls, bridged from sync graph-node functions into the
    async `UIUXAgent.run()`/`CoderAgent.run()` via `asyncio.run(...)`**, not by converting the
    graph/orchestrator/approval chain to async. This works because every current caller of
    `graph.invoke()`/`resume()` is a sync FastAPI route handler running in a worker thread with no
    event loop already active -- **if that ever changes (a route becomes `async def` and calls the
    orchestrator directly on the main event loop thread), this bridge breaks** and needs to become
    a threadsafe one (`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`). Documented directly in the node
    docstrings so this assumption isn't silently invalidated later.
14. **Discovered, not designed**: when a graph node raises (e.g. `coder_node`'s
    `CodePlanValidationError`), LangGraph's checkpoint stays at "this node is next" rather than
    either corrupting state or silently advancing past the failure -- confirmed directly
    (`get_status()` returned `next: ["coder_node"]` after the real failure below). A future
    `resume()` call would cleanly retry the same node from scratch. This is a genuinely useful
    emergent property, not something built -- worth knowing before assuming a failed node needs
    manual checkpoint surgery to recover from.
15. **`approval_service.py`'s existing broad `except Exception` around the graph-resume call
    (added in M0 to swallow `GraphNotRunningError` for artifacts approved outside a graph run)
    turns out to also correctly handle "the graph run failed downstream" for free**: when
    `coder_node` raised `CodePlanValidationError` during the real M6 end-to-end test, the human's
    `POST /artifacts/{id}/approval` call still returned its normal 200 OK (their approval action
    genuinely succeeded) while the failure was logged separately
    (`logger.exception("Failed to resume graph run...")`), not silently lost and not surfaced as a
    misleading 500 to someone who did nothing wrong. Worth keeping in mind if this error handling
    is ever "tightened" -- the current broad catch is load-bearing for more than its original
    purpose.

## Known model-quality gotchas (not code bugs — prompts already account for these)

- `qwen3-coder:latest` sometimes emits function-valued mock props (e.g. `"onSubmit": () => {}`)
  inside what must be strict JSON. Fixed in `uiux_agent/prompt.py`'s
  `COMPONENT_GENERATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT` by requiring self-contained components (internal
  `useState`, no callback props expected from outside).
- The Coder Agent planner (M3) reliably plans frontend files correctly but has repeatedly
  under-planned backend routes/models for the same feature, even after explicit "this is
  full-stack, you MUST plan both sides" instructions. `plan_validator` correctly rejects these
  incomplete plans every time it happened (5/5 real attempts across M3+M5) — this is the
  guardrail working as designed, not a bug to silently work around. **M5 implemented and tested
  the retry-with-validator-feedback loop this gotcha called for (`CoderAgent._plan_with_retries`,
  `MAX_PLANNING_ATTEMPTS=2`), and it only partially helps**: given the specific error
  "does not cover these API endpoints: [...]" plus the previous (rejected) plan, the second
  attempt correctly added the missing *data entity* (a `UserCredentials.js` file) but still never
  created an actual backend route file for the missing *endpoints* — it seems to treat a
  frontend `authService.js` that *calls* `/api/auth/login` as if that satisfies "cover this
  endpoint," not understanding it also needs the file that *implements* the endpoint
  server-side. Real end-to-end runs (`CoderAgent.run()`) currently exhaust both planning
  attempts and raise `CodePlanValidationError` for this exact feature every time — this is
  correct, cheap-failure behavior per the design (no workspace touched), but means the real
  planner cannot currently drive a real backend feature through `run()` unattended. The
  hand-validated plan (see `scripts/run_coder_pipeline_manual.py`) remains the way to exercise
  everything downstream of planning until this is improved further (candidates: even more
  explicit endpoint-vs-caller wording, one-shot few-shot example in the prompt, or accepting a
  human-edited plan as a valid input to the pipeline instead of only ever an LLM-generated one).
- The planner is prone to anchoring on the shape of context JSON shown to it (e.g. it once
  echoed the `project_manifest.json` shape back as if it were the required output). Fixed by
  explicitly marking all context as read-only and restating the exact required output schema
  immediately before generation. If a new prompt shows the model a JSON blob right before asking
  for JSON output, watch for this.
- **Ollama's server-side default context window silently truncates long agentic conversations.**
  The very first M4 coding-loop run produced a coherent tool-use trace right up through
  `read_ui_component` (which returns a whole real `.jsx` file, several KB), then a single empty
  final `AIMessage` with no tool calls and no content — the loop just stopped, having written
  zero files. This was **not** model flakiness; it was `ChatOllama` using Ollama's default
  `num_ctx` (historically 2048-4096), which the conversation blew past once a real file's
  contents entered it. Fixed in `app/providers/agentic_model_factory.py` by explicitly setting
  `num_ctx=settings.AGENTIC_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` (32768, configurable via `.env`) whenever the
  provider is `ollama`. **If a new agentic tool ever returns large content (another full file,
  a big shell command output), re-check this budget** — 32768 is comfortable for the current
  Login feature's tool outputs but isn't unlimited.
- The `node:20-slim` sandbox image (`sandbox_service`) has **no `git` binary** — the coding loop
  tried `run_shell("git status")` at the end of its M4 run and got `exit_code: 127, sh: git: not
  found`. It's on the `run_shell` allowlist (matching the doc's spec) but currently
  non-functional inside the sandbox. The model handled the failure gracefully and finished
  anyway, so this didn't block M4, but **`git status`/`git diff` via `run_shell` will never
  actually work until the sandbox image includes git** (switch to `node:20` instead of
  `-slim`, or install git in a custom image) — worth fixing before any future prompt relies on
  the agent self-checking its own diff via that tool.
- **M4's `jsonwebtoken`-missing bug was fixed in M5's hand-validated plan** (added to
  `new_dependencies`) specifically so M5 could demonstrate a genuinely *passing* verify gate, not
  just a failing one — both matter and both were proven this build: M4 showed the merge-gate
  will faithfully surface a real problem when one exists; M5 shows it lets a real, correct
  change through when `npm install` (the only step that could run, since no build/lint/test
  scripts exist yet) actually succeeds. **Caveat, stated plainly**: because there is still no
  test suite or build step that actually executes `auth.routes.js`, a *future* missing-`require`
  bug in this project would again not be caught until a real test suite exists (M7/QA Agent
  territory) — `npm install` alone only checks that declared dependencies resolve, not that
  the code correctly declares every dependency it uses.
- **Windows: `shutil.rmtree` on a git repo directory reliably fails** with either a
  `PermissionError` from git's read-only object files, or (worse, and non-obvious) "the process
  cannot access the file because it is being used by another process" from GitPython's `Repo`
  object holding an open file handle even after the test using it has gone out of scope. Fixed
  in `tests/test_coder_tools.py`/`tests/test_coder_verify.py` by (1) explicitly calling
  `workspace_service.ensure_project_repo(project_id).close()` before `rmtree`, and (2) passing
  an `onerror` handler that clears the read-only bit and retries. **Any new test that creates a
  real git repo via `workspace_service` needs both of these in its teardown**, or leftover
  `workspaces/*` directories will silently accumulate (this happened once already in M5 --
  `ignore_errors=True` was masking the failures rather than fixing them).

## Testing conventions established

- `tests/` at `services/agentic_service/tests/`, pytest (installed via pip; not yet added to
  `requirements.txt` as a formal dependency since it's dev-only so far).
- Deterministic/validator logic: hand-crafted fixtures, no LLM, fast, golden-file style where
  applicable (e.g. `test_uiux_integration_manifest_builder.py`, `test_coder_diff_builder.py`).
- LLM-touching pipelines: also verified manually at least once per milestone against the **real**
  approved Login feature data (not just synthetic fixtures) — screenshots and generated code
  visually/manually inspected, not just asserted on structurally.
- Any project/feature/artifact created purely for isolated testing is deleted from Mongo + disk
  afterward (never left as debris) -- see the Windows `shutil.rmtree` gotcha above for the
  correct teardown pattern for git-repo-backed fixtures. The real `e-commerce-platform` /
  `Login` feature data is the intentional running example and is **left in its real, evolving
  state** between milestones.
- Docker containers are checked (`docker ps -a`) after every `sandbox_service`-touching test run
  to confirm none are left running.

## Real state changes made to the actual project (not test debris — don't "clean" these up)

- `outputs/e-commerce-platform/_project/design_system.json` — created in M2, contains the
  approved `LoginForm` component entry.
- `outputs/e-commerce-platform/_project/project_manifest.json` — created in M5 by the real
  `merge_approved_feature` approval hook, contains the real routes/api_endpoints/models/
  shared_components/features derived from the merged Login feature.
- `artifact_83e3692d` (`LoginForm.jsx`, `uiux_agent`, v1) was approved during M3 tool testing
  specifically to validate `read_ui_component`'s happy path against real data. This is a
  legitimate approval (it's a genuinely good component from M2), not a mistake to revert.
- **`workspaces/e-commerce-platform/repo/` — `main` now contains the real, merged Login feature**
  (as of M5): a `--no-ff` merge commit ("Merge feature/login into main") on top of the original
  scaffold commit. `main` has: `client/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`,
  `client/src/components/LoginForm.jsx` (the actual approved UI/UX component, integrated
  verbatim via `read_ui_component`, not regenerated), `client/src/services/authService.js`,
  `server/src/routes/auth.routes.js`, `server/src/models/UserCredentials.js`, and
  `package.json`/`package-lock.json` (real `npm install` of `axios`, `bcrypt`, `dotenv`,
  `jsonwebtoken`, `jwt-decode`). The `feature/login` branch no longer exists (deleted by
  `merge_feature_branch` after the merge). **This was approved and merged through the real,
  unchanged `POST /artifacts/{id}/approval` endpoint** (`artifact_94797be2`, `code_diff`/json),
  driven by `CoderAgent.merge_approved_feature`. Verification for this merge showed
  `npm install: passed`, `build/lint/test: skipped` (no scripts configured yet in this project —
  see gotchas above for what that does and doesn't prove). M4's earlier manual-run commit on
  `feature/login` (with the then-missing `jsonwebtoken`) was superseded when M5 recreated the
  branch from scratch, as anticipated in M4's own notes.
- **The real planner (`CodePlanner`) cannot currently drive `CoderAgent.run()` unattended for
  this feature** — it exhausts both planning attempts and `run()` raises
  `CodePlanValidationError` (see gotchas above). The merge above was driven by the
  hand-validated plan in `scripts/run_coder_pipeline_manual.py`, exercising every stage
  downstream of planning (coding loop, verify, diff, artifacts, approval, merge) for real. This
  is the same precedent M4 set and is not a workaround unique to this session — expect to keep
  using it for real pipeline testing until the planner prompt is improved further.
- **M6 real end-to-end graph run for Login**: `graph_orchestrator_service.start(...)` →
  `resume("approved")` (SRS already approved) → auto-passed domain → paused at
  `approve_architecture` → `resume("approved")` (Architecture Plan already approved) → **real
  `uiux_node` ran**, producing a genuine v2 of every UI/UX artifact
  (`login_ui_metadata_v2.json`, `login_integration_manifest_v2.json`, `login_ui_design_v2.md`,
  `login_loginform_v2.jsx`, `login_login_page_v2.png` — visually confirmed, a clean styled login
  form) → paused at `approve_uiux` with the real v2 artifact IDs surfaced in graph state. Approved
  `artifact_26d13fb2` (`ui_metadata` v2) through the real `POST /artifacts/{id}/approval`
  endpoint, which (a) ran `apply_design_system_patch` again (correctly a no-op: `LoginForm`
  already existed, 0 new components/tokens merged — idempotent) and (b) resumed the graph into
  the **real `coder_node`**, which ran the real planner (both attempts, ~45s each), hit the
  documented `CodePlanValidationError`, and the exception was caught by
  `approval_service`'s existing broad exception handler (see gotcha #15 above) — the approval
  HTTP call still returned 200 OK normally. `graph_orchestrator_service.get_status(...)` now
  shows `next: ["coder_node"]` for this feature/thread — a future approval-triggered resume (or
  a fixed planner) would cleanly retry `coder_node` from there. This is the intended, correct M6
  outcome: the graph faithfully delegates to the real agents, successes and failures alike,
  through the exact same human-facing approval endpoint used throughout this whole build.
- `login_ui_metadata_v2.json` etc. (the v2 UI/UX artifacts from the run above) are real outputs
  of this milestone's verification, not test debris — left in place alongside the v1 set from M2.
